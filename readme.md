## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to write a better HTML structure and to use functions with Vanilla JavaScript.
There are some examples below:

```html
<main class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        <h1 class="card-title">Stay updated!</h1>
```

```js
function validateEmail(element) {
  //see complete function on the repository
}
```

### Continued development

Now, I am going to continue with other challenges to improve my JavaScript skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) - This helped me to know more about CSS functionality. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
